This was a 3 month group project course that I did alone. It is a Tomcat/JSP Web application
with a light frontend that mimics Triton Link, UCSD's Student portal. The first month
was schema building witch I don't have the work for but here is the final code for last two
months of the project. It demoed perfectly and received an A. 

Some interesting files are in the Root/Tables directory, specifically the students.sql. funcs.sql
and courses.sql are intersting too.
